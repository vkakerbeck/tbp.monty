  # Need to set max_match_distance low here to avoid
  # recognizing the cube as a sphere during learning.
  # The current implementation isn't optimized for few,
  # incomplete models in memory. In this case the slightly
  # curved surface of the sphere is too similar to the flat
  # surface of the cube to lead to negative evidence and the
  # sphere is not excluded from possible matches.
