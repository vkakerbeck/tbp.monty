# To test your env and help you familiarize yourself with the code, we'll run the simplest possible
# experiment. We'll use a model with a single learning module as specified in
# monty_config. We'll also skip evaluation, train for a single epoch for a single step,
# and only train on a single object, as specified in config and train_env_interface_args.

# The order of the defaults matters. The defaults are applied in order, from top to bottom.
defaults:
  # We use the pre-defined /experiment/config/supervised_pretraining values for the config (@config)
  - /experiment/config/supervised_pretraining@config
  # We use the pre-defined /experiment/config/logging/pretrain values for the logging (@config.logging)
  - /experiment/config/logging/pretrain@config.logging
  # We use the pre-defined /experiment/config/monty/patch_and_view values for the monty_config (@config.monty_config)
  - /experiment/config/monty/patch_and_view@config.monty_config
  # Set up the environment and agent.
  # We use the pre-defined /experiment/config/environment/patch_view_finder_mount_habitat values for
  # the env_interface_config (@config.env_interface_config)
  - /experiment/config/environment/patch_view_finder_mount_habitat@config.env_interface_config
  # We use the pre-defined /experiment/config/environment_interface/per_object values for
  # the train_env_interface_args (@config.train_env_interface_args)
  - /experiment/config/environment_interface/per_object@config.train_env_interface_args
