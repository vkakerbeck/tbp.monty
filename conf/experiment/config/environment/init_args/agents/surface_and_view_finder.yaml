# Use surface agent and view finder to find the object before experiment start.
#
# Adaptation of distant agent code for the surface agent to use the view finder to 
# navigate so the object is in view before the real experiment happens.

# The surface sensor is at the same position as the agent, the viewfinder is 3cm
# behind the agent. So when the agent turns, the viewfinder moves accordingly.
