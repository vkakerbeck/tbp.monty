# TODO: Likely consolidate into some other list
# "(...) a list of features we extract for experiments that involve voting.
#  I’m not sure why we specify a different list than for other experiments.
#  This might be a historical artifact from making a variable for easier
#  multi LM configs and then changing the values directly in the other configs.
#  The LMs will not actually use all [these] so theoretically we could simplify
#  and just pass the same feature lists to all the configs" -- Viviane
