title: Unsupervised Continual Learning
---

# Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to configure and run Monty experiments for [unsupervised continual learning](../../how-monty-works/experiment.md#different-phases-of-learning). In this regime, Monty learns while it explores an object and attempts to identify its identity and pose. If an object has been recognized as a previously seen item, then any knowledge gained during its exploration is added to an existing model and committed to memory. If Monty does not recognize the object, then a new model is generated for the object and stored. In this way, Monty jointly performs unsupervised learning and object/pose recognition. This mode of operation is distinct from those used in our tutorials on [pretraining](pretraining-a-model.md) and [model evaluation](running-inference-with-a-pretrained-model.md) in which learning and inference were performed in separate stages which is useful for more controlled experiments on one of the two. This tutorial is closer to the ultimate vision of Monty, where learning and inference are closely intertwined, much as they are in humans.

Our model will have one surface agent connected to one sensor module connected to one learning module. Our dataset will be comprised of two objects in the [YCB](https://www.ycbbenchmarks.com/) dataset, and each will be shown at a different random rotation for each episode. Monty will see each object three times in total.

# Setting up the Experiment Config for Continual Learning

To follow along, open the `src/tbp/monty/conf/experiment/tutorial/surf_agent_2obj_unsupervised.yaml` file.

```yaml
# @package _global_

defaults:
  # This configuration will take 1000 exploratory steps (`exp1000`) after recognizing the object to
  # collect more information about it. It also requires at least 100 train steps (`t100`) before
  # recognizing an object to avoid early misclassifications when we have few objects in
  # memory.

  - /monty/motor_system_config: surface
  - /monty/learning_module: evidence_tutorial_surf_agent_2obj_unsupervised
  # We will use the default surface sensor modules (one habitat surface patch, one logging view finder)

Looking into the details of learning module configuration in `src/tbp/monty/conf/monty/learning_module/evidence_tutorial_surf_agent_2obj_unsupervised.yaml`:

```yaml
# @package experiment.config.monty_config.learning_modules

learning_module_0:
  _target_: tbp.monty.frameworks.models.evidence_matching.learning_module.EvidenceGraphLM
  max_match_distance: 0.01
  # Tolerances within which features must match stored values in order to add
  # evidence to a hypothesis.
  tolerances:
    patch:
      hsv: ${np.array:[0.05, 0.1, 0.1]}
      principal_curvatures_log:
      - 1
      - 1
  feature_weights:
    patch:
      # Weighting saturation and value less since these might change under different
      # lighting conditions.
      hsv: ${np.array:[1, 0.5, 0.5]}
  x_percent_threshold: 20
  # Thresholds to use for when two points are considered different enough to
  # both be stored in memory.
  graph_delta_thresholds:
    patch:
      distance: 0.01
      pose_vectors: ${np.array:[np.pi / 8, np.pi * 2, np.pi * 2]}
      principal_curvatures_log:
      - 1.0
      - 1.0
      hsv:
      - 0.1
      - 1
      - 1
  # object_evidence_threshold sets a minimum threshold on the amount of evidence we have
  # for the current object in order to converge; while we can also set min_steps
  # for the experiment, this puts a more stringent requirement that we've had
  # many steps that have contributed evidence.
  object_evidence_threshold: 100
  # Symmetry evidence (indicating possibly symmetry in rotations) increments a lot
  # after 100 steps and easily reaches the default required evidence. The below
  # parameter value partially addresses this, altough we note these are temporary
  # fixes and we intend to implement a more principled approach in the future.
  required_symmetry_evidence: 20
  hypotheses_updater_args:
    max_nneighbors: 5
```

Additionally, we inspect the configuration in `src/tbp/monty/conf/env_interface/tutorial_train_2obj_random.yaml` to see how the experiment will control the environment:

```yaml
# @package experiment.config

do_train: true
train_env_interface_args:
  parent_to_child_mapping: null
  # Here we specify which objects to learn. We are going to use the mug and bowl
  # from the YCB dataset.
  object_names:
  - mug
  - bowl
  object_init_sampler:
    _target_: tbp.monty.frameworks.environments.object_init_samplers.RandomRotation
train_env_interface_class: ${monty.class:tbp.monty.experiment.environment.OneObjectPerEpisodeInterface}
```

If you have read our previous tutorials on [pretraining](pretraining-a-model.md) or [running inference with a pretrained model](running-inference-with-a-pretrained-model.md), you may spot a few differences in this setup. For pretraining, we used the `MontySupervisedObjectPretrainingExperiment` class which also performs training (and not evaluation). While that was a training-only setup, it is different from our unsupervised continual learning config since it supplies object labels to learning modules. For running inference with a pretrained model, we used the `MontyObjectRecognitionExperiment` class but specified that we only wanted to perform evaluation by using `- /env_interface: tutorial_eval_2obj_predefined_r3`, which specified `do_eval: true`. In contrast, here we used the `MontyObjectRecognitionExperiment` with `- /env_interface: tutorial_train_2obj_random`, which specifies `do_train: true` (where `do_eval: false` is the default). This combination of experiment class and `do_train`/`do_eval` arguments is specific to unsupervised continual learning. We have also increased `min_training_steps`, `object_evidence_threshold`, and `required_symmetry_evidence` to avoid early misclassification when there are fewer objects in memory.

Besides these crucial changes, we have also made a few minor adjustments to simplify the rest of the configs. First, we did not use tutorial-specific sensor module, motor system, or connectivity configs. Second, we are using a `RandomRotation` object initializer which randomly rotates an object at the beginning of each episode rather than rotating an object by a specific user-defined rotation. Third, we are using the `- /logging: basic_info_monty_runs` configuration. This is equivalent to setting up a default logging configuration and specifying that we only want a `BasicCSVStatsHandler`.

# Running the Unsupervised Continual Learning Experiment

To run this experiment, call the `run.py` script with an experiment name as the `experiment` argument like so:

```shell
python run.py experiment=tutorial/surf_agent_2obj_unsupervised
```

# Inspecting the Results
Once complete, you can inspect the simulation results and visualize the learned models. The logs are located at `~/tbp/results/monty/projects/surf_agent_2obj_unsupervised`. Open `train_stats.csv`, and you should see a table with six rows--one row for each episode. The first 7 columns should look something like this:

![](../../figures/how-to-use-monty/unsupervised_stats.png)

During epoch 0, Monty saw the mug and bowl objects for the first time. Since the observations collected during these episodes do not match any objects stored in memory, Monty reports that `no_match` has been found in the **primary_performance_column**. When no match has been found, Monty creates a new object ID for the unrecognized object and stores the learned model in memory. In the **result** column, we see that the new IDs for the mug and bowl are `new_object_0` and `new_object_1`, respectively. The objects don't have meaningful names, since no labels are provided.

In all subsequent episodes, Monty correctly identified the objects as indicated by `correct` in the **primary_performance** column. When Monty finds a match for an object in its memory, it does not simply terminate the episode. Instead, it continues to explore the object for `num_exploratory_steps` steps and then updates the object model with the new information collected during the episode.

Note that Monty receives minimal information about when a new epoch has started, with the only indication of this being that evidence scores are reset to 0 (an assumption which we intend to relax in the future). If a new object was introduced in the second or third epoch it should again detect no_match and learn a new model for this object. Also note that for logging purposes we save which object was sensed during each episode and what model was updated or associated with this object. Monty has no access to this information. It can happen that multiple objects are merged into one object or that multiple models are learned for one object. This is tracked in `mean_objects_per_graph` and `mean_graphs_per_object` in the .csv statistics as well as in `possible_match_sources` for each model to calculate whether the performance was `correct` or `confused`.

We can visualize how models are acquired and refined by plotting an object's model after different epochs. To do so, create a script and paste in the following code. The name and location of the script is arbitrary, but we called it `unsupervised_learning_analysis.py` and placed it at `~/monty_scripts`.
```python
from pathlib import Path

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch

from tbp.monty.frameworks.models.object_model import GraphObjectModel
from tbp.monty.frameworks.utils.plot_utils_dev import plot_graph


def load_graph(exp_dir: Path, epoch: int, object_name: str) -> GraphObjectModel:
    model_path = exp_dir / str(epoch) / "model.pt"
    state_dict = torch.load(model_path, weights_only=False)
    return state_dict["lm_dict"][0]["graph_memory"][object_name]["patch"]


exp_dir = Path("~/tbp/results/monty/projects/surf_agent_2obj_unsupervised").expanduser()
n_epochs = 3
obj_name = "new_object1"   # The generated object ID corresponding to the bowl

# Load object graphs
graphs = [load_graph(exp_dir, epoch, obj_name) for epoch in range(n_epochs)]

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 3))
for epoch in range(n_epochs):
    ax = fig.add_subplot(1, n_epochs, epoch + 1, projection="3d")
    plot_graph(graphs[epoch], ax=ax)
    ax.view_init(95, 90, 0)
    ax.set_title(f"epoch {epoch}")
fig.suptitle("Bowl Object Models")
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```
After running this script, you should see a plot with three views of the bowl object model at each epoch like so:

![The bowl object model after each epoch](../../figures/how-to-use-monty/unsupervised_bowl_object_models.png)

After Monty's first pass (epoch 0), Monty's internal model of the bowl is somewhat incomplete. As Monty continues to encounter the bowl in subsequent epochs, the model becomes further refined by new observations. In this way, Monty learns about new and existing object continuously without the need for supervision or distinct training periods. To update existing models, the detected pose is used to transform new observations into the existing models reference frame. For more details on how learning modules operate in this mode, see our documentation on [how learning modules work](../../how-monty-works/learning-module.md).

Thus far we have demonstrated how to build models that use a single sensor module connected to one learning module. In the [next tutorial](multiple-learning-modules.md), we will demonstrate how to configure multiple sensors and connect them to multiple learning modules to perform faster inference.
