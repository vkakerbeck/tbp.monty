Create a tutorial with your experience with Monty to accomplish some goal.

## Format Options

The tutorial can be created in either format:
- A markdown tutorial file placed in our docs at `docs/how-to-use-monty/tutorials/` and added to the `docs/hierarchy.md` file.
- YouTube video.
- Blog post.

Both formats may potentially become core documentation if they add value to the existing getting started guides.


## Potential Tutorial Topics

The good way to find a topic is to write about something you found difficult to learn, something you wish had a tutorial available.

- Running through the steps to set up Monty on a new configuration of hardware / OS. (See [AgentRev's excellent WSL tutorial](../../how-to-use-monty/getting-started/getting-started-on-windows-via-wsl.md) as an example).
- How to add FLOPs measurements to a Monty experiment.
- How to create new 3D objects and render then in the simulator.
- How to turn an existing dataset into a learning environment for Monty.
- How to add a new type of sensor.
- How to integrate a new simulator.
- How to build a new action policy.

If you'd like more ideas on what kind of tutorials might be beneficial, you can message us on the [Discourse forum](https://thousandbrains.discourse.group/) and also have a look at the [existing tutorials](../../how-to-use-monty/tutorials.md) and [contributing tutorials](../../contributing/contributing-tutorials.md) pages.
