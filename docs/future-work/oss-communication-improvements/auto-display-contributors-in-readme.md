Build an automated system that displays contributors' GitHub avatars on the root README.md file, providing visibility and recognition for community contributors.

Here is an example of how this might look/a possible technology. [All Contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors.github.io?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors-)

## Requirements

- Automatically display GitHub avatars of contributors
- No specific technology requirements - contributors can choose the best approach (GitHub Actions, external services, scripts, etc.)

## Expected Outcomes

- Contributors are visible and recognized on the main repository page
- The contributor list stays up-to-date automatically
