We  would like to organize and start a podcast series that covers the Thousand Brains Project / Theory or adjacent topics.

# Podcast Ideas

## Fundamental Concepts
- Reference Frames
- Modularity
- Sensorimotor Learning
- What can sensorimotor systems do that transformers can’t do?
- How can a system that learns the physical structure of the world do abstract things?

## Frequently Asked Questions
- What is the TBP?
- What is so special about the TBP?
- How did we pick the license?
- Why the patent non-assert pledge? What does it mean?
- Why are we making the project open-source?
- What are our goals?
- Difference between TBP and HTM? How do they relate?
- What will be challenges for the project?
- How can you participate?
- Why do you think sensorimotor AI will be important?
- What are big open questions for you?

## Neuroscience Deep Dives
- Our thoughts on what the thalamus does
- Long-range connections
- Layers and connectivity in a cortical column
- Sensorimotor learning in the brain
- Deep learning to TBP thinking
- Paper reviews, for example - Mohamed Sherif: Temporal Memory and Depression

## Interviews
- Notable authors
- Neurologists
- Researchers in related fields
- TBP team members on various aspects of the project
- Case studies interviewing people who use our platform

## Brain Structures Review
- Neocortex (probably closer to ten minutes for this one)
- Hippocampus / Entorhinal Cortex
- Thalamus
- Limbic system
- Cerebellum
- Basal Ganglia
- Amygdala
- Different areas of the neocortex
