3. Identify which themes indicate documentation gaps or unclear areas
4. Create or improve documentation to address these gaps
5. Link back to the improved documentation in forum responses

## Expected Outcomes

- Improved documentation addressing common questions
- Better user experience as common questions are answered in docs
