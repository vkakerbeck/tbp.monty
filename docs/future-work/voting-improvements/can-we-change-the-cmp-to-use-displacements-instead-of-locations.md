Since we haven't identified concrete benefits, the `improved-metric` field is left open. A first step to tackling this task would be to think through any functional implications of this change.

Movement is core to how LMs process and model the world. Currently, an LM receives an observation encoded with a body-centric location, and then infers a displacement in object-centric coordinates. Similarly, goals are specified as a target location in body-centric coordinates, which are then acted upon.

However, a more general formulation might be to use displacements as the core spatial information in the CMP, such that a specific location (in body-centric coordinates or otherwise) is not the primary form of communication outside of an LM or sensor module.

Such an approach might align well with adding information about flow (see [Detect Local and Global Flow](../sensor-module-improvements/detect-local-and-global-flow.md)), modeling moving objects (see [Deal With Moving Objects](../learning-module-improvements/deal-with-moving-objects.md)), and supporting abstract movements like the transition from grandchild to grandparent. It would also result in a reformulation of "goals" to "goal-displacements".

While this Future Work item could be viewed as falling in the category of [CMP/hierarchy improvements](../cmp-hierarchy-improvements.md), the most significant obstacle for this change is the requirement to reformulate voting such that a shared coordinate system with locations is not necessary. A voting algorithm of this kind remains a theoretical gap, although we discuss recent ideas [in this video](https://youtu.be/7bnPWJ-k3YE?si=qjFZup2tH9JixAiu&t=2923).
