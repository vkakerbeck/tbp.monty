The first step of this item was completed by [transitioning to a standard configuration management library (Hydra)](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty/pull/540). However, there is still a lot more work to be done to simplify the configs and use dependency injection. Any input and changes you would find useful as you get started with Monty's configs is appreciated!
