title: CMP & Hierarchy Improvements
description: Improvements we would like to add to the CMP or hierarchical information processing.
---
These are the things we would like to implement:

- [Figure out performance measures and supervision in heterarchy](cmp-hierarchy-improvements/figure-out-performance-measure-and-supervision-in-heterarchy.md)
- [Add top-down connections](cmp-hierarchy-improvements/add-top-down-connections.md)
- [Run & Analyze experiments with >2LMs in heterarchy testbed](cmp-hierarchy-improvements/run-analyze-experiments-with-2lms-in-heterarchy-testbed.md)
- [Test learning at different speeds depending on level in hierarchy](cmp-hierarchy-improvements/test-learning-at-different-speeds-depending-on-level-in-hierarchy.md)
- [Send similarity encoding object ID to next level & test](cmp-hierarchy-improvements/send-similarity-encoding-object-id-to-next-level-test.md)
- [Global Interval Timer](cmp-hierarchy-improvements/global-interval-timer.md)
- [Include State in CMP](cmp-hierarchy-improvements/include-state-in-CMP.md)
- [Evaluate on the Omniglot dataset](cmp-hierarchy-improvements/evaluate-on-omniglot-dataset.md)

> 📘 Heterarchy vs. Hierarchy
> 
> We sometimes use the term heterarchy to express the notion that, similar to the brain, connections in Monty aren't always strictly hierarchical. There are many long-range connections (voting) within the same hierarchical level and across level, as well as skip-connections. Also, every level in the "hierarchy" has a motor output (goal state) that it sends to the motor system. To read more about this, see our recent publication [Hierarchy or Heterarchy? A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05888).
