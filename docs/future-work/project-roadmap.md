# Tasks on Our Roadmap

Here is an interactive view of our future work that can be filtered and sorted to find tasks that match your scope appetite, skills and interests.
Click on the name to view the detail page for that task.  Click on the any of the tags in the columns to filter the table by that tag.

> [!NOTE] 
> You can contribute to any task that is not marked as `completed`. Even tasks that are currently `in-progress` usually benefit from additional input so please feel free to reach out to us about any task that peaks your interest.
> For more information on the different fields and values, see our [future work widget metadata](../contributing/documentation/future-work-widget-metadata.md) documentation page.

These are tasks where we have a rough idea of how we want to achieve them but we haven't necessarily scheduled when we will work on them or who will work on them. **We welcome anyone who would like to pick up one of these tasks and contribute to it.**

Tasks can be categorized in multiple ways:

- **Which part of Monty does it touch?** This is represented `section headers` in the table, and is organized into Sensor Module, Learning Module, Motor System, Voting, Hierarchy, Environment, Framework, and Open-Source/Communication.
- **Which capabilitie(s) does it improve?** This is represented by the `improved-metric` column. We keep track of the progress on the capabilities. Each task should improve at least one capability but can contribute to multiple.
- **What skills does it require?** This is represented in the `skills` column. Often, it is not a hard requirement to be an expert in all the skills listed but they give you a rough idea of which tasks may be a good fit given your background.
- **What type of output is expected?** This can be found in the `output-type` column. This column should give you a rough idea of the type of work this task involves. Note that you can also contribute partially to a task (e.g. develop a prototype but don't integrate it as a new monty feature).
- **What's the tasks scope?** As a rough rule of thumb, small tasks take several days, medium tasks several weeks, and large tasks several months. However, this is a very rough estimate as it doesn't take into account your daily time commitment or unexpected issues and changes in scope.

# What the TBP Team is Working On

Some of the tasks are under active development by our team or external contributors. Those have a GitHub avatar icon in the status column.

We also have two stars that mark the current top two priorities of the TBP team.

## Current Quarterly Goals
To get a more concrete idea of our goals and roadmap for Q4 - 2025, have a look at this video:

# How You Can Contribute

We are happy if one of the tasks on this list piques your interest and you would like to contribute by tackling it!

We usually have some rough ideas of how we want to implement these tasks. These are usually written out in the corresponding sections under the "Future Work" category in the docs. Click on the name of the task to view the detail page. **Please have a read of the task outlines there before starting to work on one of them**. If an item is on our roadmap document that you are interested in, but we don't have any details written out yet, please feel free to contact us and we can update the documentation.

Once you have a concrete idea of how you would like to tackle a task (whether it is similar to how we outlined it or different), the **first step is to [open an RFC](../contributing/request-for-comments-rfc.md) describing your planned approach**, unless the task specifies otherwise.

**Once your RFC is merged and active, we will add a player icon for you on the table** (using your GitHub or discourse profile picture). This way we can keep an overview of which parts of the code people are currently working on. If you decide not to pursue the implementation further, please notify us so that someone else can pick up the task.

> 📘 More Ways to Contribute
>
> Besides these more involved and research/code heavy tasks on our roadmap, there are many other ways you can get involved and support this project. Check out our page on [ways to contribute](../contributing/ways-to-contribute-to-code.md) to find out what best matches your skillset and interests.

# Tasks That Are Not in the Future Work Documentation

The future work documentation doesn't cover everything we want the system to eventually be able to do or all the ideas you might be coming up with.

This **section only contains tasks where we already have a more concrete idea of how we want to implement them**. There are many topics where we are still actively brainstorming for solutions. We have a **[collection of open questions here](../how-monty-works/open-questions.md).** And if you are interested in our thoughts on them, the best place is to watch our meeting recordings on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thousandbrainsproject).

We also welcome contributions that are not related to any of these tasks. Please remember to [fill out an RFC first](../contributing/request-for-comments-rfc.md) before working on a larger change. For a list of ways you can contribute besides code, see [this guide](../contributing/contributing.md).  

# Legacy Table

We have a high-level overview spreadsheet of tasks on our roadmap in our [project planning spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HlKqhMzYWxpW6_D0LtDd5qEuWRYHl6xMfxbIZ76lzng/edit?usp=sharing) but we are phasing this out in favor of the interactive table above.
