title: Learning Module Improvements
description: Improvements we would like to add to the learning modules.
---
We have a guide on [customizing learning modules](learning-module-improvements/contributing-learning-modules.md) here.

These are the things we would like to implement:

- [Use off-object observations](learning-module-improvements/use-off-object-observations.md) #numsteps #multiobj
- [Implement and test rapid evidence decay as form of unsupervised memory resetting](learning-module-improvements/implement-and-test-rapid-evidence-decay-as-form-of-unsupervised-memory-resetting.md)
- [Improve bounded evidence performance](learning-module-improvements/improve-bounded-evidence-performance.md)
- [Use models with fewer points](learning-module-improvements/use-models-with-fewer-points.md)
- [Test particle-filter-like resampling of hypothesis space](learning-module-improvements/test-particle-filter-like-resampling-of-hypothesis-space.md)
- [Re-anchor hypotheses for robustness to noise and distortions](learning-module-improvements/re-anchor-hypotheses.md) 
- [Less dependency on first observation](learning-module-improvements/less-dependency-on-first-observation.md) 
- [Deal with incomplete models](learning-module-improvements/deal-with-incomplete-models.md)
- [Deal with moving objects](learning-module-improvements/deal-with-moving-objects.md)
- [Support scale invariance](learning-module-improvements/support-scale-invariance.md)
- [Improve handling of symmetry](learning-module-improvements/improve-handling-of-symmetry.md)
- [Use Better Priors for Hypothesis Initialization](learning-module-improvements/use-better-priors-for-hypothesis-initialization.md)
- [Learn hot spots on objects](learning-module-improvements/learn-hot-spots-on-objects.md)
- [Include State in Models](learning-module-improvements/include-state-in-models.md)
- [Include State in Hypotheses](learning-module-improvements/include-state-in-hypotheses.md)
- [Event Detection to Reset Timer](learning-module-improvements/event-detection-to-reset-timer.md)
- [Speed Detection to Adjust Timer](learning-module-improvements/speed-detection-to-adjust-timer.md)
