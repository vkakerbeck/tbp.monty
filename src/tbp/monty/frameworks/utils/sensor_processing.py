    """Correct displacement to true arc length on a curved surface.

    When a sensor moves along a curved surface, the straight-line displacement
    measured in the tangent plane underestimates the true distance traveled
    along the curve. This function corrects that by converting the displacement
    projection back to the actual arc length.

    The correction assumes that the surface is locally a circle. This approximation
    holds well when curvature is approximately constant over the displacement,
    but is inaccurate for surfaces with rapidly varying curvature.

    The relationship between arc length and its tangent-plane projection on a
    circle of curvature k is:

        tangent_projection = sin(k * arc_length) / k
        arc_length        = arcsin(k * tangent_projection) / k

    Reference:
        Do Carmo, M.P. "Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces",
        2nd ed., Dover, 2016, Section 3-2.

    Note:
        The formula works for both convex and concave surfaces because the
        arc-to-projection geometry on a circle is the same regardless of the sign
        of curvature.

    Args:
        tangent_projection: Signed displacement component projected onto a
            tangent-plane basis direction.

        threshold: Skip correction when |k * p| < threshold (the flat
            approximation is already accurate).

    Returns:
        Estimated signed arc length. Returns tangent_projection unchanged if
