    """Monty class for unsupervised inference without explicit episode resets.

    This variant of `MontyForEvidenceGraphMatching` is designed for unsupervised
    inference experiments where objects may change dynamically without any reset
    signal. Unlike standard experiments, this class avoids resetting Monty's
    internal state (e.g., hypothesis space, evidence scores) between episodes.

    This setup better reflects real-world conditions, where object boundaries
    are ambiguous and no supervisory signal is available to indicate when a new
    object appears. Only minimal state — such as step counters and termination
    flags — is reset to prevent buffers from accumulating across objects. Additionally,
    Monty is currently forced to switch to Matching state. Evaluation of unsupervised
    inference is performed over a fixed number of matching steps per object.

    *Intended for evaluation-only runs using pre-trained models, with Monty
    remaining in the matching phase throughout.*

        # Track whether `pre_episode` has been called at least once.
        # There are two separate issues this helps avoid:
        #
        # 1. Some internal variables in SMs and LMs (e.g., `stepwise_targets_list`,
        #    `terminal_state`, `is_exploring`) are not initialized
        #    in `__init__`, but only inside `pre_episode`. Ideally, these should be
        #    initialized once in `__init__` and reset in `pre_episode`, but fixing
        #    this would require changes across multiple classes.
        #
        # 2. The order of operations: Graphs are loaded into LMs *after* the Monty
        #    object is constructed but *before* `pre_episode` is called. Some
        #    functions (e.g., in `EvidenceGraphLM`) depend on the graph being loaded to
        #    compute initial possible matches inside `pre_episode`, and this cannot
        #    be safely moved into `__init__`.
