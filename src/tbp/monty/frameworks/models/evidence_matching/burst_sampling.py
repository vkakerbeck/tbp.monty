class BurstSamplingHypothesesUpdater:
    """Hypotheses updater that adds and deletes hypotheses based on evidence slope.

    This updater enables updating of the hypothesis space by intelligently sampling
    and rebuilding the hypothesis space when the model's prediction error is high. The
    prediction error is determined based on the highest evidence slope over all the
    objects hypothesis spaces. If the hypothesis with the highest slope is unable to
    accumulate evidence at a high enough slope, i.e., none of the current hypotheses
    match the incoming observations well, a sampling burst is triggered. A sampling
    burst adds new hypotheses over a specified `sampling_burst_duration` number of
    consecutive steps to all hypothesis spaces. This burst duration reduces the effect
    of sensor noise. Hypotheses are deleted when their smoothed evidence slope is below
    `deletion_trigger_slope`.

    The burst sampling process is governed by four main parameters:
      - `sampling_multiplier`: Determines the number of hypotheses to sample during
        bursts as a multiplier of the object graph nodes.
      - `deletion_trigger_slope`: Hypotheses below this threshold are deleted.
      - `sampling_burst_duration`: The number of consecutive steps in each burst.
      - `burst_trigger_slope`: The threshold for triggering a sampling burst. This
        threshold is applied to the highest global slope over all the hypotheses (i.e.,
        over all objects' hypothesis spaces). The range of this slope is [-1, 2].

    To reproduce the behavior of `DefaultHypothesesUpdater` sampling a fixed number of
    hypotheses only at the beginning of the episode, you can set:
        - `sampling_multiplier=2` (or `umbilical_num_poses` if PC undefined)
        - `deletion_trigger_slope=-np.inf` (no deletion is allowed)
        - `sampling_burst_duration=1` (sample the full burst over a single step)
        - `burst_trigger_slope=-np.inf` (never trigger additional bursts)

    These parameters will trigger a single-step burst at the first step of the episode.
    Note that if the PC of the first observation is undetermined,
    `sampling_multiplier` should be set to the value of `umbilical_num_poses` to
    reproduce the exact results of `DefaultHypothesesUpdater`. In practice, this is
    difficult to predict because it relies on the first sampled observation.

        Args:
            feature_weights: How much each feature should be weighted when
                calculating the evidence update for a hypothesis. Weights are stored
                in a dictionary with keys corresponding to features (same as keys in
                tolerances).
            graph_memory: The graph memory to read graphs from.
            max_match_distance: Maximum distance between a tested location and a stored
                location for them to be matched.
            tolerances: How much each observed feature can deviate from the
                stored features while still being considered a match.
            evidence_threshold_config: How to decide which hypotheses
                should be updated. In the `BurstSamplingHypothesesUpdater` we always
                update 'all' hypotheses. Hypotheses with decreasing evidence are deleted
                instead of excluded from updating. Must be set to 'all'.
            feature_evidence_calculator: Class to calculate feature evidence for all
                nodes. Defaults to the default calculator.
            feature_evidence_increment: Feature evidence (between 0 and 1) is
                multiplied by this value before being added to the overall evidence of
                a hypothesis. This factor is only multiplied with the feature evidence
                (not the pose evidence, unlike the present_weight). Defaults to 1.
            features_for_matching_selector: Class to
                select if features should be used for matching. Defaults to the default
                selector.
            sampling_multiplier: Determines the number of hypotheses to sample during
                bursts as a multiplier of the object graph nodes. Value of 0.0 results
                in no sampling. Value can be greater than 1 but not to exceed the
                `num_hyps_per_node` of the current step. Defaults to 0.4.
            deletion_trigger_slope: Hypotheses below this threshold are deleted.
                Expected range matches the range of step evidence change, i.e.,
                [-1.0, 2.0]. Defaults to 0.5.
            sampling_burst_duration: The number of steps in every sampling burst.
                Defaults to 5.
            burst_trigger_slope: A threshold below which a sampling burst is triggered.
                Defaults to 1.0.
            include_telemetry: Flag to control if we want to calculate and return the
                burst sampling telemetry in the `update_hypotheses` method. Defaults to
                False.
            initial_possible_poses: Initial
                possible poses to test. Defaults to "informed".
            max_nneighbors: Maximum number of nearest neighbors to consider in the
                radius of a hypothesis for calculating the evidence. Defaults to 3.
            past_weight: How much the evidence accumulated so far should be
                weighted when combined with the evidence from the most recent
                observation. Defaults to 1.
            present_weight: How much the current evidence should be weighted
                when added to the previous evidence. If past_weight and present_weight
                add up to 1, the evidence is bounded and can't grow infinitely. Defaults
                to 1.
                NOTE: Right now this doesn't give as good performance as with unbounded
                evidence since we don't keep a full history of what we saw. With a more
                efficient policy and better parameters, that may be possible to use and
                could help when moving from one object to another and generally make
                setting thresholds more intuitive.
            umbilical_num_poses: Number of sampled rotations in the direction of
                the plane perpendicular to the surface normal. These are sampled at
                umbilical points (i.e., points where PC directions are undefined).

        For each channel, the method identifies the top-k nodes with the highest
        feature match scores to the current step's input and samples hypotheses only
        from those nodes. The number of hypotheses per channel is pre-computed
        by ``_sample_count``.

        The sampling includes:
          - Selecting the top-k node indices based on evidence scores, where k is
             determined by the channel's sample count and its num_hyps_per_node.
          - Fetching the 3D locations of only the selected top-k nodes.
          - Generating rotations for each hypothesis using one of two strategies:
            (a) If `initial_possible_poses` is set, rotations are uniformly sampled or
                user-defined.
            (b) Otherwise, alignments are computed between stored node poses and
                sensed directions.

        This targeted sampling improves efficiency by avoiding unnecessary computation
        for nodes with low evidence, especially beneficial when this sampling occurs
        at every step.

        Args:
            features: Input features keyed by channel name.
