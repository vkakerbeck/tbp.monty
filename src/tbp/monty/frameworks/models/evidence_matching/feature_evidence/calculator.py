        """Calculate the feature evidence for all nodes stored in a graph.

        For each node, compares the stored features against the observed
        query features and returns a score in `[0, 1]`: 1 for a perfect
        match, decaying to 0 once the difference exceeds the per-feature
        tolerance. Nodes with missing stored values for a feature receive
        NaN evidence.

        Args:
            channel_feature_array: Stored features for every node in the
                graph, shape `(n_nodes, n_columns)`. Columns follow the
                layout given by `channel_feature_order`.
            channel_feature_order: Feature names in the order they appear
                across the columns of `channel_feature_array`.
            channel_feature_weights: Per-feature weights used to combine
                per-column evidence into a single per-node score.
            channel_query_features: Observed feature values to compare
                against the stored features, keyed by feature name.
            channel_tolerances: Per-feature tolerance, the largest
                difference that still produces non-zero evidence.
            input_channel: The channel the observation came from, used to
                select which features in the graph to compare against.

        Returns:
            The feature evidence for all nodes, shape `(n_nodes,)`.
