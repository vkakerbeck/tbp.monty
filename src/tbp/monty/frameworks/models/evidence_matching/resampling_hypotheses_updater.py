class ResamplingHypothesesUpdater:
    """Hypotheses updater that resamples hypotheses at every step.

    This updater enables updating of the hypothesis space by resampling and rebuilding
    the hypothesis space at every step. We resample hypotheses from the existing
    hypothesis space, as well as new hypotheses informed by the sensed pose.

    The resampling process is governed by two main parameters:
      - `hypotheses_count_multiplier`: scales the total number of hypotheses every step.
      - `hypotheses_existing_to_new_ratio`: controls the proportion of existing vs.
          informed hypotheses during resampling.

    To reproduce the behavior of `DefaultHypothesesUpdater` sampling a fixed number of
    hypotheses only at the beginning of the episode, you can set
    `hypotheses_count_multiplier=1.0` and `hypotheses_existing_to_new_ratio=0.0`.

    Note:
        It would be better to decouple the amount of hypotheses added from the amount
        deleted in each step. At the moment, this is decided by the
        `hypotheses_count_multiplier`. For example, when the multiplier is set to 1.0,
        the hypotheses sampled is equal to the hypotheses removed. We ideally can
        decouple theses then use a slope threshold to decide on which hypotheses to
        remove, and use prediction error or other heuristics to decide to how many
        hypotheses to resample.

                dictionary with keys corresponding to features (same as keys in
                tolerances).
            graph_memory: The graph memory to read graphs from.
            max_match_distance: Maximum distance of a tested and stored location
                to be matched.
            tolerances: How much can each observed feature deviate from the
                stored features to still be considered a match.
            feature_evidence_calculator: Class to calculate feature evidence for all
                nodes. Defaults to the default calculator.
            feature_evidence_increment: Feature evidence (between 0 and 1) is
                multiplied by this value before being added to the overall evidence of
                a hypothesis. This factor is only multiplied with the feature evidence
                (not the pose evidence as opposed to the present_weight). Defaults to 1.

                selector.

                existing vs. newly sampled hypotheses during resampling. Defaults to

            include_telemetry: Flag to control if we want to calculate and return the
                resampling telemetry in the `update_hypotheses` method. Defaults to
                False.
            initial_possible_poses: Initial
                possible poses that should be tested for. Defaults to "informed".
            max_nneighbors: Maximum number of nearest neighbors to consider in the
                radius of a hypothesis for calculating the evidence. Defaults to 3.
            past_weight: How much should the evidence accumulated so far be
                weighted when combined with the evidence from the most recent
                observation. Defaults to 1.
            present_weight: How much should the current evidence be weighted
                when added to the previous evidence. If past_weight and present_weight
                add up to 1, the evidence is bounded and can't grow infinitely. Defaults
                to 1.
                NOTE: right now this doesn't give as good performance as with unbounded
                evidence since we don't keep a full history of what we saw. With a more
                efficient policy and better parameters that may be possible to use

                generally make setting thresholds etc. more intuitive.

                the plane perpendicular to the surface normal. These are sampled at

        """Samples the specified number of fully informed hypotheses.

        This method selects hypotheses that are most likely to be informative based on
        feature evidence. Specifically, it identifies the top-k nodes with the highest
        evidence scores and samples hypotheses only from those nodes, making the process
        more efficient than uniformly sampling from all graph nodes.

        The sampling includes:
          - Selecting the top-k node indices based on evidence scores, where k is
             determined by the `informed_count` and the number of hypotheses per node.
          - Fetching the 3D locations of only the selected top-k nodes.
          - Generating rotations for each hypothesis using one of two strategies:
            (a) If `initial_possible_poses` is set, rotations are uniformly sampled or
                user-defined.
            (b) Otherwise, alignments are computed between stored node poses and
                sensed directions.

        This targeted sampling improves efficiency by avoiding unnecessary computation
        for nodes with low evidence, especially beneficial when informed sampling occurs
        at every step.

        Args:
            channel_features: Input channel features.
            informed_count: Number of fully informed hypotheses to sample.
            graph_id: Identifier of the graph being queried.
