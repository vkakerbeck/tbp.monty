        Args:
            feature_weights: How much should each feature be weighted when
                calculating the evidence update for hypothesis. Weights are stored in a
                dictionary with keys corresponding to features (same as keys in
                tolerances).
            graph_memory: The graph memory to read graphs from.
            max_match_distance: Maximum distance of a tested and stored location
                to be matched.
            tolerances: How much can each observed feature deviate from the
                stored features to still be considered a match.
            feature_evidence_calculator: Class to
                calculate feature evidence for all nodes. Defaults to the default
                calculator.
            feature_evidence_increment: Feature evidence (between 0 and 1) is
                multiplied by this value before being added to the overall evidence of
                a hypothesis. This factor is only multiplied with the feature evidence
                (not the pose evidence as opposed to the present_weight). Defaults to 1.
            features_for_matching_selector: Class to
                select if features should be used for matching. Defaults to the default
                selector.
            initial_possible_poses: Initial
                possible poses that should be tested for. Defaults to "informed".
            max_nneighbors: Maximum number of nearest neighbors to consider in the
                radius of a hypothesis for calculating the evidence. Defaults to 3.
            past_weight: How much should the evidence accumulated so far be
                weighted when combined with the evidence from the most recent
                observation. Defaults to 1.
            present_weight: How much should the current evidence be weighted
                when added to the previous evidence. If past_weight and present_weight
                add up to 1, the evidence is bounded and can't grow infinitely. Defaults
                to 1.
                NOTE: right now this doesn't give as good performance as with unbounded
                evidence since we don't keep a full history of what we saw. With a more
                efficient policy and better parameters that may be possible to use
                though and could help when moving from one object to another and to
                generally make setting thresholds etc. more intuitive.
            umbilical_num_poses: Number of sampled rotations in the direction of
                the plane perpendicular to the surface normal. These are sampled at
                umbilical points (i.e., points where PC directions are undefined).
