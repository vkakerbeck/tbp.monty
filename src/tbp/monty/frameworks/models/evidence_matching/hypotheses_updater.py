        Args:
            feature_weights: How much each feature should be weighted when
                calculating the evidence update for a hypothesis. Weights are stored
                in a dictionary with keys corresponding to features (same as keys in
                tolerances).
            graph_memory: The graph memory to read graphs from.
            max_match_distance: Maximum distance of a tested and stored location
                for them to be matched.
            tolerances: How much can each observed feature deviate from the
                stored features while still being considered a match.
            evidence_threshold_config: How to decide which hypotheses
                should be updated. When this parameter is either '[int]%' or
                'x_percent_threshold', then this parameter is applied to the evidence
                for the Most Likely Hypothesis (MLH) to determine a minimum evidence
                threshold in order for other hypotheses to be updated. Any hypotheses
                falling below the resulting evidence threshold do not get updated. The
                other options set a fixed threshold that does not take MLH evidence into
                account. In [int, float, '[int]%', 'mean', 'median', 'all',
                'x_percent_threshold']. Defaults to 'all'.
                Ignored by the DefaultHypothesesUpdater. Required for
                compatibility with the HypothesesUpdater protocol.
            feature_evidence_calculator: Class to
                calculate feature evidence for all nodes. Defaults to the default
                calculator.
            feature_evidence_increment: Feature evidence (between 0 and 1) is
                multiplied by this value before being added to the overall evidence of
                a hypothesis. This factor is only multiplied with the feature evidence
                (not the pose evidence, unlike the present_weight). Defaults to 1.
            features_for_matching_selector: Class to
                select if features should be used for matching. Defaults to the default
                selector.
            initial_possible_poses: Initial
                possible poses to test. Defaults to "informed".
            max_nneighbors: Maximum number of nearest neighbors to consider in the
                radius of a hypothesis for calculating the evidence. Defaults to 3.
            past_weight: How much should the evidence accumulated so far be
                weighted when combined with the evidence from the most recent
                observation. Defaults to 1.
            present_weight: How much should the current evidence be weighted
                when added to the previous evidence. If past_weight and present_weight
                add up to 1, the evidence is bounded and can't grow infinitely. Defaults
                to 1.
                NOTE: Right now this doesn't give as good performance as with unbounded
                evidence since we don't keep a full history of what we saw. With a more
                efficient policy and better parameters, that may be possible to use and
                could help when moving from one object to another and generally make
                setting thresholds more intuitive.
            umbilical_num_poses: Number of sampled rotations in the direction of
                the plane perpendicular to the surface normal. These are sampled at
                umbilical points (i.e., points where PC directions are undefined).
