class EvidenceSlopeTracker:
    """Tracks the slopes of evidence streams over a sliding window.

    This tracker supports adding, updating, pruning, and analyzing hypotheses
    in a hypothesis space. Slopes are reported as evidence change per channel
    per step, so they remain comparable when the set of input channels active at
    each step varies.

    Note:
        - One optimization might be to treat the array of tracked values as a ring-like
            structure. Rather than shifting the values every time they are updated, we
            could just iterate an index which determines where in the ring we are. Then
            we would update one column, which based on the index, corresponds to the
            most recent values.
        - Another optimization is only track slopes not the actual evidence values. The
            pairwise slopes for previous scores are not expected to change over time
            and therefore can be calculated a single time and stored.
        - We can also test returning a random subsample of indices with
            slopes < mean(slopes) for `to_remove` instead of using `np.argsort`.

    Attributes:
        _window_size: Number of past values to consider for slope calculation.
        _min_age: Minimum number of updates before a hypothesis can be considered for
            removal.
        _evidence_buffer: Hypothesis evidence buffer of shape (N, window_size).
        _hyp_age: Hypothesis age counters of shape (N,).
        _channels_buffer: Per-step number of input channels active at each slot of
            the sliding window, shape (window_size,). Used by `calculate_slopes` to
            normalize per-step diffs.
