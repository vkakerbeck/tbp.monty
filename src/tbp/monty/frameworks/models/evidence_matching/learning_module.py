class EvidenceGraphLM(GraphLM):
    """Learning module that accumulates evidence for objects and poses.

    Matching Attributes:
        max_match_distance: Maximum distance of a tested and stored location to
            be matched.
        tolerances: How much can each observed feature deviate from the stored
            features to still be considered a match.
        feature_weights: How much should each feature be weighted when calculating
            the evidence update for hypotheses. Weights are stored in a dictionary with
            keys corresponding to features (same as keys in tolerances)
        feature_evidence_increment: Feature evidence (between 0 and 1) is multiplied
            by this value before being added to the overall evidence of a hypothesis.
            This factor is only multiplied with the feature evidence (not the pose
            evidence as opposed to the present_weight).
        evidence_threshold_config: How to decide which hypotheses
            should be updated. When this parameter is either '[int]%' or
            'x_percent_threshold', then this parameter is applied to the evidence
            for the Most Likely Hypothesis (MLH) to determine a minimum evidence
            threshold in order for other hypotheses to be updated. Any hypotheses
            falling below the resulting evidence threshold do not get updated. The
            other options set a fixed threshold that does not take MLH evidence into
            account. In [int, float, '[int]%', 'mean', 'median', 'all',
            'x_percent_threshold']. Defaults to 'all'.
        vote_evidence_threshold: Only send votes that have a scaled evidence above
            this threshold. Vote evidences are in the range of [-1, 1] so the threshold
            should not be outside this range.
        past_weight: How much should the evidence accumulated so far be weighted
            when combined with the evidence from the most recent observation.
        present_weight: How much should the current evidence be weighted when added
            to the previous evidence. If past_weight and present_weight add up to 1,
            the evidence is bounded and can't grow infinitely. NOTE: right now this
            doesn't give as good performance as with unbounded evidence since we don't
            keep a full history of what we saw. With a more efficient policy and better
            parameters that may be possible to use though and could help when moving
            from one object to another and to generally make setting thresholds etc.
            more intuitive.
        vote_weight: Vote evidence (between -1 and 1) in multiplied by this  value
            when being added to the overall evidence of a hypothesis. If past and
            current_weight add up to 1, it is use as weight in np.average to keep
            the evidence in a fixed range.

    Terminal Condition Attributes:
        object_evidence_threshold: Minimum required evidence for an object to be
            recognized. We additionally check that the evidence for this object is
            significantly higher than for all other objects.
        x_percent_threshold: Used in two places:
            1) All objects whose highest evidence is greater than the most likely
                objects evidence - x_percent of the most like objects evidence are
                considered possible matches. That means to only have one possible match,
                no other object can have more evidence than the candidate match's
                evidence - x percent of it.
            2) Within one object, possible poses are considered possible if their
                evidence is larger than the most likely pose of this object - x percent
                of this poses evidence.
            # TODO: should we use a separate threshold for within and between objects?
            If this value is larger, the model is usually more robust to noise and
            reaches a better performance but also requires a lot more steps to reach a
            terminal condition, especially if there are many similar object in the data
            set.
        path_similarity_threshold: How similar do paths have to be to be
            considered the same in the terminal condition check.
        pose_similarity_threshold: difference between two poses to be considered
            unique when checking for the terminal condition (in radians).
        required_symmetry_evidence: number of steps with unchanged possible poses
            to classify an object as symmetric and go into terminal condition.

    Model Attributes:
        graph_delta_thresholds: Thresholds used to compare nodes in the graphs being
            learned, and thereby whether to include a new point or not. By default,
            we only consider the distance between points, using a threshold
            of 0.001 (determined in remove_close_points). Can also specify
            thresholds based on e.g. surface normal angle difference, or principal
            curvature magnitude difference.
        max_graph_size: Maximum size of a graph in meters. Any observations that fall
            out of this range will be discarded/used for building a new model. This
            constraints the size of models that an LM can learn and enforces learning
            models of sub-components of objects.
        max_nodes_per_graph: Maximum number of nodes in a graph. This will be k when
            picking the k-winner voxels to add their content into the graph used for
            matching.
        num_model_voxels_per_dim: Number of voxels per dimension in the model grid.
            This constraints the spatial resolution that the model can represent.
            max_graph_size/num_model_voxels_per_dim = how much space is lumped into one
            voxel. All locations that fall into the same voxel will be averaged and
            represented as one value. num_model_voxels_per_dim should not be too large
            since the memory requirements grow cubically with this number.
        gsg_class: The type of goal-state-generator to associate with the LM.
        gsg_args: Dictionary of configuration parameters for the GSG.
        hypotheses_updater_class: The type of hypotheses updater to associate with the
            LM.
        hypotheses_updater_args: Dictionary of configuration parameters for the
            hypotheses updater.

    Debugging Attributes:
        use_multithreading: Whether to calculate evidence updates for different
            objects in parallel using multithreading. This can be done since the
            updates to different objects are completely independent of each other. In
            general it is recommended to use this but it can be useful to turn it off
            for debugging purposes.
