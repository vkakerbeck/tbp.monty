            min_post_goal_success_steps: Number of necessary steps for a hypothesis
                Goal to be considered. Unlike elapsed_steps_factor, this is a
                *necessary* criteria for us to generate a new hypothesis-testing Goal.
                For example, if set to 5, then the agent must take 5
                non-hypothesis-testing steps before it can even consider generating a
                new hypothesis-testing Goal. Infinity by default, resulting in no use
                of the hypothesis-testing policy (desirable for unit tests etc.).
                Defaults to np.infty.
            x_percent_scale_factor: Scale x-percent threshold to decide when to focus
                on pose rather than determining object ID; in particular, this is used
                to determine whether the top object is sufficiently more likely (based
                on MLH evidence) than the second MLH object to warrant focusing on
                disambiguating the pose of the first; should be bounded between 0:1.0.
                If x_percent_scale_factor=1.0, then will wait until the standard
                x-percent threshold is exceeded, equivalent to the LM converging to a
                single object, but not a pose. If it is <1.0, then we will start testing
                pose of the MLH object even before we are entirely certain about its ID.
                Defaults to 0.75.
            desired_object_distance: The desired distance between the agent and the
                object, which is used to determine whether the agent is close enough to
                the object to consider it "achieved". Note this need not be the same as
                the one specified for the motor-system (e.g. the surface-policy), as we
                may want to aim for an initially farther distance, while the
                surface-policy may want to stay quite close to the object. Defaults to
                0.03.

        The aim is to propose a point for the model to test, with the aim of performing
        object pose and ID recognition, by looking at the graph of the most likely
        object, and comparing it to the graph of the second most likely object. If there
        is a local mismatch in the graphs (e.g. the presence of a handle in one and not
        the other), this should return the necessary coordinates to move there.

        Returns the index of the point in the graph of the most likely object that
        should be tested, along with the size of the L-2 separation of this point to
        the nearest point in the graph of the second most likely object.

        --- Some Details ---
        Part of this method transforms the graph of the most likely object into
        the reference frame in which the 2nd most-likely object was *learned*.
        We perform this operation because when comparing the two point-clouds (using
        the points of the most-likely object as queries), we can then re-use the KDTree
        already constructed for the 2nd most-likely object, hence the importance of
        being in that reference frame

        TODO M eventually can try looking at more objects, or flipping the MLH
        object - e.g. if the two most likely are the mug and one of the handle-less
        cups, then depending on the order in which we compare them, we may not
        actually identify the handle as a good candidate to test (i.e. if one graph is
        entirely a subset of the other graph). We could use the returned separation
        distance to estimate which of these approaches would be better.
        - i.e. imagine 2nd MLH is a mug with a handle, and MLH has no handle; when
        checking all the points for the handleless mug, there will always be nearby
        points.
        - Re. implementing this: could start with the MLH as the query points, looking
        for points with minimal neighbors with the 2nd most likely graph; if found
        too many neighbors in a given radius (threshold dependent), this suggests
        the 1st MLH graph is a sub-graph of the 2nd MLH; therefore, check whether
        the 2nd graph has any points with few neighbors with the first; if still many
        neighbors, this could then serve as a learning signal to merge the graphs?
        (at least at some levels of hierarchy) --> NB merging should use "picky" graph-
        building method to ensure we don't just double the number of points in the graph
        unnecessarily.

        TODO M consider adding a factor so that we ensure our testing spot is also far
        away from any previously visited locations (at least according to MLH path),
        including our current location.
