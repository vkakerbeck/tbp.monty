class SurfacePolicyCurvatureInformed(SurfacePolicy):
    """Policy class for a more intelligent surface-agent.

    Includes additional functions for moving along an object based on the direction
    of principle curvature (PC).

    A general summary of the policy is that the agent will start following PC directions
    as soon as these are well defined. This will initially be the minimal curvature; it
    will follow these for as long as they are defined, and until reaching a certain
    number of steps (max_pc_bias_steps), before then changing to follow maximal
    curvature. This process continues to alternate, as long as the PC directions are
    well defined.

    If PC are not meaningfully defined (which is often the case), then the agent uses
    standard momentum to take a step in a direction similar to the previous step
    (weighted by the alpha parameter); it will do this for a minimum number of steps
    (min_general_steps) before it will consider using PC information again.

    If the agent is taking a step that will bring it to a previously visited location
    according to its estimates, then it will attempt to correct for this and choose
    another direction; after finding a new heading, the agent performs a minimum number
    of steps (min_heading_steps) before it will check again for a conflicting heading.

    The main other event that can occur is that PCs are defined, but these are
    predominantly in the z-direction (relative to the agent); in that case, the
    PC-defined heading is ignored on that step, and a standard, momentum-based step is
    taken; such z-defined PC directions tend to occur on e.g. the rim of cups and
    are presumably due to issues with the agents re-orientation steps vs. noisiness
    of the PCs defined by the surface

    TODO update this method to accept more general notions of directions-of-variance
    (rather than strictly principal curvature), such that it can be applied in more
    abstract spaces
