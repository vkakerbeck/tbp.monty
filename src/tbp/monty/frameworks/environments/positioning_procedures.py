    used by the distant agent after a "jump" has been initialized by a model-based

    First, the agent is moved towards the target object until the object fills a minimum
    of percentage (given by `good_view_percentage`) of the sensor's field of view or the
    closest point of the object is less than `good_view_distance` from the sensor.

    sensor's field of view. Otherwise small objects may be too small to perform saccades
    or the sensor ends up inside of big objects. This step is performed by default but
    can be skipped by setting `allow_translation=False`.

    Second, the agent will then be oriented towards the object so that the sensor's
    central pixel is on-object. In the case of multi-object experiments,
    (i.e., when `multiple_objects_present=True`), there is an additional orientation
