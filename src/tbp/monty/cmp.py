class Message:
    """Message class used as message packages passed in Monty using CMP.

    The cortical messaging protocol (CMP) is used to pass messages between Monty
    components and makes sure we can easily set up arbitrary configurations of them.
    This class makes it easier to define the CMP in one place and defines the content
    and structure of messages passed between Monty components. It also contains some
    helper functions to access and modify the message content.

    States are represented in this format but can be interpreted by the receiver in
    different ways:
       Observed states: states output by sensor modules
       Hypothesized states: states output by learning modules
       Goals: motor output of learning modules

    Attributes:
        location: 3D vector representing the location
        morphological_features: dictionary of morphological features. Should include
            pose_vectors of shape (3,3) and pose_fully_defined (bool).
        non_morphological_features: dictionary of non-morphological features.
        confidence: message confidence. In range [0,1].
        use_state: boolean indicating whether the message should be used or not.
        sender_id: string identifying the sender of the message.
        sender_type: string identifying the type of sender. Can be "SM" or "LM".
